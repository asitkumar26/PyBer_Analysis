# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview & Purpose of Project:

        - Prepare and visulaize weekly ride sharing data for different city types (e.g. Urban, Suburban and Rural) using techonologies like 'Python pandas dataframe' to derive the insights.
        - Analyze the ride sharing patterns from the plotted graphs and provide reccomendation to PyBer so that they can improve their ride sharing business for future growth.


## PyBer Analysis Results:

### Ride patterns for different city types:
       - In rural cities, total rides, total drivers and total fares is the least among all city types.Total drivers are less(just 78 drivers) compared to Urban(1625) and Suburban(625). But rides are quite expensive as average fare per ride is the highest in rural.
       But drivers in rural cities are well paid as average fare per driver is the maximum.           
       - In Urban cities, total rides and total fares is maximum , but ratio of no of rides/driver is the least among of all city types.
         Average fare per driver is the least in urban cities compared to all city types.

### Weekly/Monthly visual view of total fares for different city type:
       - During the weeks of April, ride fares for Urban city type consitently stayed high relatively.
       - For Urban cities, most of weeks between January to April of 2019, the total rates have been more than $2000.
       - During the weeks of April, a sharp increase in total fare for Suburban is seen. 
       - For Rural cities, fares have been below $500 all the weeks.

## PyBer Analysis Summary:
        - In case of Rural cities, increase the number of drivers so that average share per ride becomes less and more people can afford PyBer ridesharing.
        - There is more potential on ride sharing demand in Urban cities, so PyBer can think about expanding in Urban cities.
        - More advertisements required in Urban cities so that number of rides can increase.
        - Take steps to improvise the Average fare per driver in urban cities by keeping the ratio of Number of rides per driver better. Otherwise drivers will leave the PyBer.
